## VR

### **Q: Why does the VR app crash?**
It really shouldn't! If you experience a crash or unexpected behaviour, please contact me immediatly and tell me exactly what happened.

### **Q: I can't change things in my room anymore**
You can only change the room of the current day, meaning that all rooms of the past can only be visited, but no longer edited. This is to prevent users from altering their memories and distorting them.

### **Q: I am worried about my privacy**
Key facts:
- We will never look at the content of your memories
- Memory is only sent to Google Analysis servers if you **explicitly** state you want to, otherwise none of your memories will be stored outside of the VR headset and your own phone
- At the end of the experiment you can transfer all of your memory content from the headset to your own computer and then delete all your data from the headset, before giving it back
- Your interview results will be anonymized
- If you are still unomfortable, please contact me directly. We can also end the experiment prematurely if you wish.

### **Q: I don't know what I am supposed to do**
Please contact me, you can call me any time or write me an email.

E-Mail: d.p.rosenbusch@gmail.com

Phone: +49 157757 04560

### **Q: I can't find a photo / video but I know it's on my phone**
Hit the top-left menu icon in the file-chooser. Make sure you are looking in the right place (maybe a photo wasn't taken with your camera but sent via WhatsApp?).

Also consider that our app does **not** read your text messages. If a photo was sent to you via a messenger app, you will need to manually save it on your phone so that our app can detect it.

### **Q: What else can I do with the headset?**
You can play games! Check out the installed apps and games by pressing on the grid-symbol at the bottom of the menu screen (see [here](#starting-the-vr-app)).

If you have the headset with the letter **Y**, you will find these cutting edge games installed:

- Beat Saber: A thrilling rhythm game in which you have to slice projectiles with light sabers to the beat of a song
- Super Hot: A shooting game in which time only passes if you move, giving you crucial moments of planning before engaging in combat with an overwhelming amount of enemies

You can also log-in to your netflix account and watch movies in a virtual cinema. Beyond that there is a catalogue of free to play games, either installed or downloadable. Go nuts!
