### **Q: I am worried about my privacy**
Key facts:
- We will never look at the content of your memories
- Memory is only sent to Google Analysis servers if you **explicitly** state you want to, otherwise none of your memories will be stored outside of the VR headset and your own phone
- At the end of the experiment you can transfer all of your memory content from the headset to your own computer and then delete all your data from the headset, before giving it back
- Your interview results will be anonymized
- If you are still unomfortable, please contact me directly. We can also end the experiment prematurely if you wish.

### **Q: I don't know what I am supposed to do**
Please contact me, you can call me any time or write me an email.

E-Mail: d.p.rosenbusch@gmail.com

Phone: +49 157757 04560

### **Q: I can't find a photo / video but I know it's on my phone**
Hit the top-left menu icon in the file-chooser. Make sure you are looking in the right place (maybe a photo wasn't taken with your camera but sent via WhatsApp?).

Also consider that our app does **not** read your text messages. If a photo was sent to you via a messenger app, you will need to manually save it on your phone so that our app can detect it.

### Q:** What else can I do with the headset?**
