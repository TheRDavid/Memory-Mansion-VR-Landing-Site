Hit the top-left menu icon in the file-chooser. Make sure you are looking in the right place (maybe a photo wasn't taken with your camera but sent via WhatsApp?).

Also consider that our app does **not** read your text messages. If a photo was sent to you via a messenger app, you will need to manually save it on your phone so that our app can detect it.
